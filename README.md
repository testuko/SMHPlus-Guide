![menu](docs/img/menu.png)

SMH+ allows you to change the player skin or any other supported skin at any time, ingame, without restarting. <br>
You can individually choose and combine textures from any supported skinmod.

<br>
 
**For Skin Modders**:

Reskin the game! No need to get frustrated with hardcoded assets. SMH+ adds support for:

```yaml
* Separate hair and bang textures for all sprites that have hair.
* Custom hair length, color and texture customization.
* Custom death particle for player and Theo crystal etc.  
* Custom particles for feathers and boosters.
* Compatibility for dash refill skinning.
* New features if you as you ask!
* And a lot more.
```

A list of reskinnable textures can be found [**here**](https://github.com/AAA1459/SkinModHelper/wiki/Textures-list-of-Various-Type).


Making your skinmod compatible takes a few small steps.
See the [**guide**](docs/guide/README.md) for more information.
